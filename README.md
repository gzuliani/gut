# GUT

A simplified C++ unit test framework inspired by a talk Kevlin Henney gave at
the "Skill Matters" conference in 2010 (see
[Rethinking Unit Testing in C++](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/1361-kevlin-henney-rethinking-unit-testing-in-c-plus-plus)).
Development started in 2012, source code arrived here in 2018.

Currently used on Windows 7/10 with Visual Studio Community Edition 2015 & 2017,
on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 with Clang 3.8 and Gcc 7.3.
